# Student Performance Prediction using Regression

an End-to-End ML project for predicting a student's performance in an exam based on many factors.

## Features

- Logging.
- Custom Exceptions.
- Data preprocessing and transformation Pipelines.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using various visualizations.
- Application of the many Regression models and comparison between them.
- Hyperparameter tuning.
- Validation Techniques.
- Deployment to Azure using Github actions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites  

You can install the required packages using the requirements.txt file provided in this repository. To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Dataset

The dataset "stud.csv" should be placed in the "notebook/data" directory within the repository.

## Models Trained

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- AdaBoost Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- CatBoost Regressor

(P.S.) I took the app down after successfully deploying it.
